 * The Comparable interface allows an object to define its own sorting rule using the compareTo() method.
 *
 * - The compareTo() method is used to compare objects.
 * - It returns:
 *      - Negative value if 'this' object should come first in sorting.
 *      - Positive value if the other object should come first.
 *      - Zero if both are considered equal in sorting.
 *
 * - Many Java classes like String and Integer already implement Comparable, allowing sorting without a Comparator.

/*
 * Comparator vs. Comparable
 * A comparator is an object with one method that is used to compare two
 * different objects.
 * 
 * A comparable is an object which can compare itself with other objects.
 * 
 * It is easier to use the Comparable interface when possible, but the
 * Comparator interface is
 * more powerful because it allows you to sort any kind of object even if you
 * cannot change its code.
